Being an 'older' and one who came to yoga in 40's with knee surgery few years back, I am happily in my best physical & mental health ever. I only wish I had started at a younger age. I know that I use techniques in everyday life for coping during stressful times. I take the time to notice and observe before reacting. I am more attuned to the good days too. At a physical level, I feel stronger, more energized and willing to push myself further to that 'edge'....such a gift at this point in my life when balance and bone & muscle strength are more important than ever.  At Upasana Foundation, everyone of every level feels welcome in this cozy, nurturing space.  I consider this my yoga “home” and am thankful and amazed at how far I have come on my personal journey there. .",

I have been practicing Shakti Kriya continuously for about 08 months, due to which the problem of cold which I have had for about 10 years has been cured. I am a government employee and the practice of action helps reduce stress and keep me energized throughout the day. My fear and shyness decreased and my courage and self-confidence increased. There is also progress in spiritual matters, and the performance of this action leads to divine experiences such as vibration in the chakras. All in all, those who want development in worldly and otherworldly matters should definitely attend this camp. My heartwarming tribute to the Charan Kamalas of the Most Reverend Guru Sadhguru Shri Rama who guided such a great achievement.....",

SadhguruShri would often speak about various aspects of spirituality and how people could inculcate in their daily lives.As a child, SadhguruShri dreamt of being a Sanyasi following a spiritual path when he grew up. At age 16 SadhguruShri chose to leave home and walk the spiritual path. He ventured all over India in search of the true meaning of life. After seeking guidance from many seers across North and South India, SadhguruShri started teaching yoga by organizing yoga camps also known as Kriyatmak Yog Shibir.",
