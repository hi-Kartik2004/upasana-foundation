      description:
        "From a very young age SadhguruShri had a fondness for spirituality & religious practices. He had a special affinity for bhajans, kirtans and harikathas and would never miss an opportunity to attend such events. SadhguruShri would often speak about various aspects of spirituality and how people could inculcate in their daily lives.As a child, SadhguruShri dreamt of being a Sanyasi following a spiritual path when he grew up. At age 16 SadhguruShri chose to leave home and walk the spiritual path. He ventured all over India in search of the true meaning of life. After seeking guidance from many seers across North and South India, SadhguruShri started teaching yoga by organizing yoga camps also known as Kriyatmak Yog Shibir.",
